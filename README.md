## EVE Fleet Manager MCP Server

An MCP server that provides tools and resources for EVE Online fleet management: authorize your fleet via SSO, inspect composition and structure, organize squads, invite/kick members, and update MOTD.

mcp-name: io.github.tedfytw1209/mcp-server-EVEfleet

### Features
- Fleet SSO authorization and status
- Auto-refreshing fleet data and structure
- Organize formations (squads/wings) by ship types
- Bulk invite and kick utilities
- Fleet MOTD updates (append/replace)
- Composition and losses history
- Ship utilities (type → group, lists of types/groups)

### Install
- pip: `pip install mcp-server-evefleet`
- uv: `uv pip install mcp-server-evefleet`

### Authenticate (first run)
- On first run you’ll be guided through EVE SSO. A refresh token will be saved automatically to a cross‑platform location:
  - Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%/mcp_server_evefleet/refresh_token.txt
  - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/mcp_server_evefleet/refresh_token.txt
  - Linux: ~/.config/mcp_server_evefleet/refresh_token.txt
- If `refresh_token.txt` exists in the current directory, it will be used and then persisted to the proper location.
